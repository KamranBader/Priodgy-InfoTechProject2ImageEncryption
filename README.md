Image Encryption Decryption with Python

 Overview
This Python application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for encrypting and decrypting images using the Caesar cipher technique. It utilizes the tkinter library for the GUI, Pillow (PIL) for image processing, and OpenCV for additional image operations.

Features
	Image Selection: Allows users to open and display images from their file system.
	Encryption: Encrypts selected images using a randomized key generated with numpy.
	Decryption: Decrypts encrypted images, restoring them to their original state.
	User Interface: The GUI includes buttons for image selection, encryption, decryption, and exiting the application.

Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language.
tkinter: Python's standard GUI library.
Pillow (PIL): Python Imaging Library for image processing tasks.
OpenCV: Computer vision library for additional image handling.

How to Use
1. Open Image: Click the "Choose" button to select an image file (PNG, JPG, JPEG).
2. Encrypt: Encrypt the chosen image to generate a new encrypted version.
3. Decrypt: Decrypt the previously encrypted image to restore it.
4. Exit: Safely close the application.

 Requirements
	Python 3.x
	tkinter, Pillow, OpenCV, numpy

	Adding more advanced cryptographic algorithms.
	Improving the user interface with additional features and customizations.
